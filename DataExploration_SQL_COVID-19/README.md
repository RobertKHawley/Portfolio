I have attached a copy of the dataset.
The data was sourced from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths (make sure drag start date as early as available before downloading)
I split .csv into two Excel workbooks: 
1) The population column was inserted behind the 'total_deaths' column. 
2) The first workbook includes the columns 'iso_code' to 'weekly_hosp_admissions_per_million' (26 columns)
3) The second workbook includes the columns 'iso_code' to 'population' (5 columns) + 'new_tests' to 'human_development_index' (32 columns)
